# flappyBird

I am recreating the old flappy bird phone game in python using the pygame library. I am adding a menu screen so that the player can choose what kind of bird they want to use, implementing a highscore and score to keep track of the players score, animation on the birds wings so that it looks like the birds wings are moving, when space bar is pressed the bird will jump as it will continue to fall and make its way through the pipes, and implementing a gameover screen when the bird collides with the pipes or falls to the ground.
