## Main game:

The user is greeted with main game screen with the colored bird they picked. The main game will have the game back ground image, the floor that appears
to be moving, the colored bird the user picked, the current score, and pipes moving towards the bird one which should be inverted from the other creating
a small space where the bird could jump through. The user can press the spacebar so the bird can go up 9 pixels which also going down 0.25 pixels to simulate
gravity. If the bird touches either pipe, the moving floor or the roof then a death sound effect will play and the game over screen will be shown. If the user
wants to play again then they simply need to press spacebar again. 

If the user presses the escape key while the game is active or the game over screen is shown then they will be prompted back to the main menu screen where they
can choose from one of the birds once again.
